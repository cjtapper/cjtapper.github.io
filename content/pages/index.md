I’m a software engineer specialising in Python, Django, and React.
I live in Canberra, Australia.

By day, I'm co-founder & software consultant at [O(1)](https://0of1.com).
We provide technical guidance and engineering resources to early stage startups to help bring their ideas to fruition.

Outside of work, I’m interested in cooking, coffee, reading sci-fi & fantasy, and self-sufficiency.
