## About
I’m a software engineer specialising in Python, Django, and React.
I live on the south coast of NSW, Australia with my wife and dog.

By day, I'm Lead Software Engineer at [Supply Chain Warehouses](https://www.supplychainwarehouses.com).

Outside of work, I’m interested in cooking, coffee, reading sci-fi, and spending time outdoors.

If you’d like to work with me, or just want to say hi, shoot me an email here: [mail@cjtapper.com](mailto:mail@cjtapper.com)
