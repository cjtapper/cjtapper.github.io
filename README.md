This repo contains the code for [www.cjtapper.com](www.cjtapper.com)

My goal is to keep the HTML as minimal as possible, while still being valid HTML.

We can validate the HTML using the [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/).

Let's keep each page [under 14kB](https://endtimes.dev/why-your-website-should-be-under-14kb-in-size/)!
