# Chris Tapper

I'm a software developer specialising in Python and Django, based in Canberra, Australia.

By day, I work as a senior software engineer at [O(1)](https://www.0of1.com).
We provide technical guidance and engineering resources to early stage startups to help bring their ideas to fruition.

Outside of work, I'm interested in cooking, espresso, reading, and self-sufficiency.

If you'd like to work with me, shoot me an email here: [mailto:mail@cjtapper.com](mailto:mail@cjtapper.com)
